Mugah, From the day we're going to step into the sunkening we arrive on the planet and blinking step into the sun there's more to see than can ever be seen more to do than can ever be done There's far too much to take in here Or to find than can ever be found But the sun rolling high Through the sapphire sky keeps great and small On the endless round It's the circle of life I move the soul through despair and hope and hope our place Through despair we can hold Through faith and love Till we find our place For love have been widely In the circle of the circle of life I'm gonna be a man who Mabana Mvada Mvina Mika Mika Mika Mora Mada Mbara Mbara Mbara Mbana Mbana Mbana Mawana Mawana Mataataataata Mataata Mata Mataa Mata Mataa Mata Mataa Mataa Mataa Mataa Mataaaaa I'm a circle of life And it moves us all over through despair and hope. Through faith and love Can we find our place? for the half of glory. In the circle, the circle of life. Thank you.
