 The snow glows white on the mountain night, not a footprint to be seen. A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen. The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside. Couldn't keep it in. Heaven knows I tried. Don't let them in, don't let them see. Be the good girl you always have to be. Concealed, don't feel, don't let them know. Well, now they know.

Let it go, let it go, you'll ever see me cry. Here I stand, and here I stay. Let the shore rage on My power flurries through the air into the ground My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around And one thought crystallizes like an ice for last. I'm never going back. The past is in the past. Let it go, let it go, let it go, when I'll rise like the break on dawn. Let it go, let it go, that perfect girl that's gone. Here I stand, then all I am there. Let the storm rage on The coal never bothered me anyway Let it go Let it go Dress my pockets on the door And here I stand Let it go Let it go
