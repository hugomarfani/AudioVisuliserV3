 I can see what's happening. What? And they don't have a clue. Who? They'll fall in love, and here's the bottom line. Our trio's down to two. Oh. The sweet caress of twilight. There's magic everywhere. And with all this romantic atmosphere, disasters in the air. Can you feel the love tonight? The peace the evening brings the world for once in perfect harmony with all its living face. Many things to tell her, but how to make her see. The truth about my past, impossible, she'd turn away from me. He's holding back, he's hiding, but what I can't decide. Why won't he be the king I know he is, the king I see inside? tonight the peace the evening is The world for once in perfect holidays with all this living place Can you feel the love tonight if you need you need you need to be a lot tonight? Look too far Stealing through The night's unsurchees Love is where they are And if he falls in love tonight It can be assumed His carefree days with us are history. In short, our pal is doomed.
