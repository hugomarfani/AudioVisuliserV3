 You see tonight it could go either way. Hearts balanced on a razor blade. We are designed to love and break, and to rinse and repeat it all again. I get stuck when the world's too loud, Things don't look up when you're going down. I know your arms are reaching out from somewhere beyond the clouds. You make me feel like my troubled heart is a million miles away. You make me feel like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in a space, Celestia. Celestia I see the light shining through the rain a thousand collars in a brighter shade needed to rise from the lowest place there's silver lining that surrounds the gray When I get lost, will it come back around? Things don't look up when you're going down. I know your arms they are reaching out from somewhere beyond the clouds. You make me feel like my troubled heart is a million miles away. You make me feel like I'm drunk on stars, and we're dancing out in a space. Celestia Celestia Celestia Oh Oh Oh We were made to be Nothing more than this Finding magic in all the smallest things The way we notice That's what really matters Let's make to make to make to be You make me make me feel We were made to be nothing more than this Finding magic in all the smallest thing The way we notice that's what really matters Let's make tonight go on and on and on You make me feel Like my troubled heart is a million miles away You made me feel Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in a space. Celestia. Oh, oh, celestial. Oh, celestial. Oh, celestial. We are made to be nothing more than this. Burning magic All this song is there We know is that's what a really matter Says Stangelo That's a Yeah Thank you. Thank you.
