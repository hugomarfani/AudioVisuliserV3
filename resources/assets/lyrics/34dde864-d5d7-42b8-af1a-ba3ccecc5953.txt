 The Snow Glows White on the mountain tonight, not a footprint to be seen. Looks like I'm the queen. The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside. Couldn't keep it in heaven knows I can't try. Don't let them in, don't let them see. Be the good girl you always have to be. Concealed, don't feel, don't let them know. Oh.
