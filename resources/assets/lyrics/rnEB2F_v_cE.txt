 Oh, I don't know why, but I've always loved the idea of summer and sun and all things hot. Really? I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat. Nope. But sometimes I like to close my eyes and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come. Kids will blow dand a lion fuzz And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer They drink in my hand my snow up against the burning sand Probably getting gorgeously tanned in summer I'll finally see a summer breeze blow away a winter storm I'll find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm And I can't wait to see what my buddies all full of me. Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer. La da, da, da, da, da. A bra-ba-ba-ba-ba-bo. The hot, the cold are both so intense. Put them together, it just makes sense. Rata-da-da-da-da-da-da-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-w. Winters a good time to stay in and cuddle, but put me in summer, and I'll be a... Happy Snowman! When life gets rough I like to hold on to my dream of relaxing in the summer sun, just letting off steam. Oh, the sky will be blue, and you guys'll be there too. When I finally do what frozen things do in summer... I'm gonna tell him. Don't you dare. Insombe Insombe Insombe Thank you. Thank you.
