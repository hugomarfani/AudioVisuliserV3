 The Snow glows white on the mountain tonight, not a footprint to be seen. A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the queen. Howling like this swirling storm inside? Couldn't keep it in heaven knows I tried. Don't let them in, don't let them see. Be the good girl you always have to be. Concealed, don't feel, don't let them know. Well, now they know. Let it go, let it go Can't hold it back anymore
