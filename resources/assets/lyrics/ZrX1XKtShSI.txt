 The window is open, so's that door. I didn't know they did that anymore. Who knew we owned 8,000 salad plates? For years I've roamed these empty halls. Why have a ballroom with no balls? Finally they're opening up the gates. There'll be actual real-life people. It'll be totally strange. But wow, am I so red? Am I so ready for this change? Cause for the first time in forever, there'll be music, there'll be light. For the first time in forever, I'll be dancing through the night. Don't know if I'm elated or gassy, but I'm somewhere in that zone. Because for the first time in forever I won't be alone I can't wait to meet everyone What if I meet the one Tonight imagine me gown and all Fetchingly draped against the wall The picture of sophisticated grace I suddenly see him standing there A beautiful stranger tall and fair I want to stuff some job would earn my face But then we laugh and talk all evening, which is totally bizarre. Nothing like the life I'm left so far. For the first time in forever, there'll be magic, they'll be fun. For the first time in forever, I could be noticed by someone. And I know it is totally crazy to dream I'd find romance But for the first time in forever At least I've got a chance Don't let them in, don't let them see Be the good girl you always have to be Conceal, don't feel, put on a show, make one wrong move and everyone will know. But it's only for today. It's only for today. It's agony to wait. Tell the guards to open up the game. The game. For the first time in first time in first. I'm in forever I'm getting this life I'm dreaming of A chance to change my lonely world A chance to find true love I can still don't feel Don't let them know it all ends tomorrow So it has to be today Because for the first time in forever For the first time in forever Nothing's in my way
