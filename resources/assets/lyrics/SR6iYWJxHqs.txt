 Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live. Oh, take, take it all, but you never give. Should have known you was trouble from the first kiss. Had your eyes wide open? Why were they open? Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash. You tossed it in the trash. You did. To give me all your love is all I ever ask Cause what you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for you Throw my hand on a blade for you I jump in front of a tree for you You know I do anything for you Oh oh I would go through all this pain Take a bullet straight through my brain Yes, I would die for you, baby But you won't do the same No, no, no, no Black, black and blue Beat me till I'm numb, tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from Mad woman, bad woman, that's just a woman, that's just a woman, Woman, that's just what you are. Yeah, you'll smile in my face and rip the brakes out my car. Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash. Tost it in the trash. Yes, you did. To give me all your love is all I ever asked. Because what you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for you. Throw my hand on a blade for you. I jump in front of a train for you You know I do anything Oh yeah Oh oh I would go through all this pain Take a bullet straight through my brain Yes I would die for you baby But you won't do the same If my body was on fire Ooh, you watched me burn down in flames You said you love me, you're a liar Because you never, ever, ever Did, baby But darling, I still catch a grenade for you Throw my hand on a blade for you I jump in front of a train, oh yeah You know I do anything, oh yeah Oh, oh I will go through all this pain Take a bullet straight through my brain Yes, I would die for you, baby But you won't do the same No, you won't do the same No, you won't do the same You wouldn't do the same Ooh, you never do the same Oh, no, no, no.
