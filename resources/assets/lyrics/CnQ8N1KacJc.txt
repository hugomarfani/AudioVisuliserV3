 Another turning point of fork stuck in the road. Time grabs you by the rest, directions where to go. So make the best of this test and don't ask why. It's not a question but a lesson learning. and learning time. It's something unpredictable, and in the end is right, I hope you at the time of your life. So take the photographs and still frames in your mind, hanging on a shelf in good health and good time Tattoes and memories and dead skin on trial For what it's worth it was worth all the while It's something unpredictable But in the end is right I hope you add the time of your life It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right, I hope you at that time of your life. It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right, I hope you had the time of your life. Thank you.
