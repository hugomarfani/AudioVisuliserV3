 I've been staring at the edge of the water long as I can remember, never really knowing why. I wish I could be the perfect daughter, but I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try. Every turn I take, every trail I track, every path I make, every road leads back to the place I know where I cannot go, where I long to be. See the line where the sky needs to sea, it calls me. And no one knows how far it goes. If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me. One day, oh, no. If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go. I know everybody on this island seems so happy on this island. Everything is by design. I know everybody on this island has a roll on this island, so maybe I can roll with mine. I can lead with pride, I can make a strong, I'll be satisfied by play along, but the voice inside seems a different song, what is wrong with me? See the lives as it shines on the sea, it's lightning, but no one knows how deep it goes. And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me and let me know What's beyond that line will I cross that line? The line where the sky hits the sea it calls me And no one knows how far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I will know How far I would go
